# What's New

## Dynamic staking limit (Supply Cap) added to Umbrella

Governance can now set a maximum amount of capital that can be staked per pool. This helps to:

- Manage staking demand and prevent excessive inflows
- Protect the target APY for stakers

For example, since the potential APY is calculated based on a recommended maximum staked amount, if the cap is set to a certain level and the pool reaches this limit, no further deposits will be accepted — helping to maintain the intended yield.

**Note:** Existing positions are not affected by the staking cap. If you deposited before the cap was implemented, your position remains active and unchanged.

## Zero cooldown option (technical update)

Umbrella now supports instant withdrawals, if zero cooldown is enabled. Currently, no pools have zero cooldown set; this is a technical capability that may be activated in the future.
