The Umbrella system operates through a network of interconnected smart contracts – automated programs that execute financial operations without human intervention. These contracts work together to manage the protection system, each handling specific responsibilities while communicating with the others.

Once deployed, they operate 24/7 across multiple blockchain networks, constantly monitoring conditions and executing actions when predetermined criteria are met. In Umbrella's case, the contracts manage everything from detecting reserve shortfalls to distributing rewards to participants.
