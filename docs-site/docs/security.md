# Security

Umbrella has undergone comprehensive security measures to ensure the safety and reliability of the system. Beyond standard development practices, multiple layers of security reviews have been implemented to protect user funds and system integrity.

## Security Audits

Aside from the usual unit/end-to-end testing of the smart contracts and all BGD's internal quality assurance processes, we have engaged and completed all planned external security reviews:
