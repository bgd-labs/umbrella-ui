## I have different assets than the ones enabled in this proposal, or I am using Aave on another non-Ethereum network. Will I be able to use Umbrella?

We plan to expand Umbrella to include additional Aave pools in the near future, incorporating assets that do not require staking, provided they do not accrue a deficit. Therefore, even if you currently do not have USDC, USDT, ETH, or GHO on Ethereum to stake, you should still be able to participate with other assets in the future, subject to Aave governance decisions.

## What is the role of BGD Labs in the project?

As service providers to the Aave DAO, we designed and developed Umbrella. However, like other Aave DAO smart contracts, we do not control the instances activated by governance proposals. Our ongoing role involves monitoring system functionality and security while suggesting improvements and supporting other service providers working with Umbrella. Additionally, we developed and maintain one instance of the official [**Aave Umbrella UI owned by the DAO**](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-umbrella-ui) at [**stake.onaave.com**](https://stake.onaave.com/). This software is fully permissioned and can be accessed by anyone; it assists users of the Umbrella smart contracts in building transactions and visualizing data.
