# Umbrella UI

[**Aave Umbrella UI**] (https://stake.onaave.com) is the official web interface that provides users with comprehensive access to Umbrella's staking functionality. This modern application serves as the primary gateway for users to interact with Umbrella smart contracts, offering an intuitive experience for managing staked positions, claiming rewards, and monitoring yields across multiple blockchain networks.

The interface handles complex blockchain interactions behind the scenes, automatically managing token wrapping, transaction building, and wallet connections. Users can seamlessly stake various assets, track their earnings in real-time, and execute withdrawal procedures through a streamlined user experience that abstracts away the technical complexity of direct smart contract interaction.
